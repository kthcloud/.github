# Welcome to kthcloud!

We are excited to have you as a potential contributor to our project. **kthcloud** is a student-run cloud provider that aims to provide a free and open source alternative to commercial cloud services. Our project is funded by KTH CBH and the Erasmus+ program of the European Union.

The project was kickstarted by the thesis "Designing and implementing a private cloud for student and faculty software projects" by Pierre Le Fevre and Emil Karlsson in 2022. You can find the thesis at http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313601.

## Contributing

As a contributor, you can help us improve and expand our cloud services. We welcome contributions of all kinds, from code contributions to bug reports and feature suggestions. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out, we encourage you to get involved.

Our cloud platform is available at https://cloud.cbh.kth.se/, where users can create VMs and deploy containers. We use Discord for account requests and support, so please join our server at https://discord.gg/MuHQd6QEtM to get started.

To contribute to our project, you can check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kthcloud). There, you will find our source code, documentation, and issue tracker. We use GitHub for our development process, so be sure to familiarize yourself with it if you are not already.
